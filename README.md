## üîó How They Connect

1. The frontend (HTML + JS) is hosted via **Firebase Hosting**.
2. When an image is uploaded:
   - It is stored in **Firebase Storage**.
   - The download URL is saved in **Firestore**.
3. The app fetches the saved URLs from **Firestore** to display images.
4. (Optional) A **Cloud Function** can be used to send an email when a new image is uploaded.
